# Off-the-Rack

This project is an RDBMS lab assignment, building a womenâ€™s e-commerce platform using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js). The platform offers a curated selection of clothing, jewelry, shoes, and bags. A robust database handles product listings, seller and customer information, and streamlines the order process to ensure a seamless shopping experience.
